## 📖 Project Overview

The **AI Powered Missing Person Identification System** is an intelligent face recognition application designed to assist in locating missing persons using **Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision**.

The system detects faces from **images, videos, webcams, and CCTV camera feeds**, generates facial embeddings using **InsightFace**, and compares them with registered missing person records using **Cosine Similarity**. A user-friendly **Streamlit** interface enables easy registration, searching, and real-time monitoring.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Every year, thousands of people go missing, making it difficult for law enforcement agencies and families to locate them quickly. Traditional identification methods rely heavily on manual observation, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient when dealing with large volumes of CCTV footage or video surveillance.

This project aims to develop an **AI-powered Missing Person Identification System** that automatically detects and identifies missing persons from images, recorded videos, live webcam streams, and CCTV feeds. By leveraging **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Face Recognition**, the system provides a faster, more accurate, and automated approach to missing person identification.

|------------|---------|
| Organization | Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Patna |
| Training Program | Foundations of AI & ML |
| Duration | 08 June 2026 – 10 July 2026 |
| Grade | A+ |
| Project | AI Powered Missing Person Identification System |

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| Programming Language | Python |
| Frontend | Streamlit |
| Object Detection | YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) |
| Face Recognition | InsightFace |
| Computer Vision | OpenCV |
| Machine Learning | Scikit-Learn |
| Database | SQLite |
| Numerical Computing | NumPy |

## 🧠 Model Training

The face detection model was trained using **YOLOv8** with **Transfer Learning** on the **WIDER FACE Dataset**. The dataset contains face images with different poses, scales, lighting conditions, and occlusions, making it suitable for robust face detection.

### Training Details

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Model | YOLOv8 |
| Training Method | Transfer Learning |
| Dataset | WIDER FACE |
| Image Size | 640 × 640 |
| Annotation | YOLO Format |
| Output | `best.pt` |

After face detection, **InsightFace (buffalo_l)** generates a **512-dimensional face embedding**, which is matched against registered embeddings using **Cosine Similarity** for missing person identification.
